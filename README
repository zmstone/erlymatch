%% Redefine assertEqual and assertMatch macros provided by otp eunit

%% include:
-include_lib("erlymatch/include/erlymatch.hrl").

%% usage:
?assertEqual(ExpectedValue, RealValue).
?assertMatch(ExpectedPattern, RealValue).

%% This two macros both test the assertion and return (also print) the 
%% detailed mismatch information to make debug easier

%% For example, if we have a record defined as below:
-record(rec, [field_1, field_2]).

%% When assertMatch is called as:
?assertMatch(#rec{field_1 = something}, #rec{field_1 = somethnig,
                                             field_2 = ignored}).

%% The output to standard io would be:
Match failed in module <module name> at line <line number>:
  details: #red{...}
       field_1: EXPECT = something
                   GOT = somethnig
       field_2: ignored
